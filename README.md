# Micromouse simulator

A 3D simulator built with Three.js that visualizes a Micromouse navigating through a maze.

## How It Works

- Load a Maze: Add a maze in plain sting format.

- Load a Path: Add an array with the solution path.

- Watch the Animation: See the Micromouse follow the path through the maze.
